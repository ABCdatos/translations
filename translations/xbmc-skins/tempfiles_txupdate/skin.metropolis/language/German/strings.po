msgid "Biographies are a sub-genre of the larger drama and epic film genres. These films depict the life of an important historical personage (or group) from the past or present era. They cross many genre types, since these films might showcase a western outlaw, a criminal, a musical composer, a religious figure, a war-time hero, an entertainer, an artist, an inventor or doctor, a politician or President, or an adventurer."
