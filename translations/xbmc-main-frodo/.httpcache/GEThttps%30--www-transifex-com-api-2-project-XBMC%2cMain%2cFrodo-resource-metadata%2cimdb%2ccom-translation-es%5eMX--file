"Download Movie information from www.imdb.com\n"
"The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is a HUGE collection of movie information. They try to catalog every pertinent detail about a movie, from who was in it, to who made it, to trivia about it, to filming locations, and even where you can find reviews and fan sites on the web. They then do their best to present this information in a manner that is easy to search and access."
