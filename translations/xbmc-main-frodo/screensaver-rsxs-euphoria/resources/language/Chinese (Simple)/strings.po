msgctxt "Addon Description"
msgid "This is about as psychedelic as screensavers get. mogumbo thought his Plasma saver was at the top of the scale, but this one is even more nauseating. You'd better find one of those air sickness bags before you stare at this one for too long."
msgstr "这大概是最具迷幻效果的屏幕保护程序了。mogumbo以为他的Plasma屏保已经是数一数二了，但这个更令人作犯晕。如果你要长时间盯视它最好先准备一个晕机袋。"
