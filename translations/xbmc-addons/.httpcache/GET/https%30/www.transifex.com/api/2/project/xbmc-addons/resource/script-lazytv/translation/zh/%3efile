msgid ""
"LazyTV can be set to one of two primary functions. The first creates and "
"launches a randomised playlist of the TV episodes. The second populates a "
"new window with the next available episode for each of your TV Shows. LazyTV"
" identifies the last viewed episode for each of your shows, and populates "
"the playlist with the next available episode. You can filter your TV Shows "
"using a built-in, custom filter or an existing Smart Playlist. The custom "
"filter allows you to exclude shows based on show name, genre, episode "
"length, or rating. Other features include: set the number of shows in the "
"playlist; exclude episodes from unwatched series, include multiple episodes "
"of the same show,  begin playlist with latest unfinished TV episode."
