"LazyTV can be set to one of two primary functions. The first creates and "
"launches a randomised playlist of the TV episodes. The second populates a "
"new window with the next available episode for each of your TV Shows. LazyTV"
" identifies the last viewed episode for each of your shows, and populates "
"the playlist with the next available episode. You can filter your TV Shows "
"using a built-in, custom filter or an existing Smart Playlist. The custom "
"filter allows you to exclude shows based on show name, genre, or rating. "
"Other features include: set the number of shows in the playlist; exclude "
"episodes from unwatched series, include multiple episodes of the same show."
